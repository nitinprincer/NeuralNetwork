* Tensorflow
* [CUDA 9.0](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-90-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64&target_version=10&target_type=exenetwork)


## Image Recognition using neural network is completed in 3 different ways
* Training and testing the result which can be found [here](https://github.com/nitinprincer/Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural%20Network/Image%20Recognition/Training%20%26%20Predicting)
* Saving the trained data and using that later to test which can be found [here](https://github.com/nitinprincer/Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural%20Network/Image%20Recognition/Using%20Saved%20Features)
* Using Google API from Google Cloud Platform and testing the result which can be found [here](https://github.com/nitinprincer/Neural-Network/tree/master/Neural%20Network/Image%20Recognition/Using%20Google%20API)
